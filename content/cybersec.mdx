When I started coding, "Cyber Security" felt like a different world—a dark art practiced by people in hoodies in dimly lit rooms. But as I transitioned into professional Full-Stack engineering, I realized something critical: **Security isn't a feature you add at the end; it’s a mindset you start with.**

We live in an era where data breaches destroy reputations and bottom lines. As a developer, I realized that if the software I build isn't secure, it isn't just "buggy"—it's a liability. I refuse to ship code that puts users or businesses at risk.

### To Build It, You Must Know How to Break It

The best way to stop a hacker is to think like one.

I am not content with just knowing how to build an API; I want to know exactly how someone would try to exploit it. This drive has led me down the rabbit hole of **Offensive Security** and **Penetration Testing**.

Currently, I am expanding my toolkit beyond standard development:
* **Reconnaissance:** Using **OSINT** and tools like **Recon-ng** to understand attack surfaces.
* **Exploitation:** leveraging frameworks like **Metasploit** to understand vulnerabilities in real-time.
* **Defense:** Writing Python scripts to automate security checks within my CI/CD pipelines.

### The Business Value of "Paranoid" Development

Why does this matter to a potential employer or client? Because fixing a security flaw in production costs 100x more than fixing it in development.

By integrating security concepts into my workflow—sanitizing inputs, understanding SQL injection vectors, and managing dependencies strictly—I don't just write code that works. I write code that **lasts**.

I am building a bridge between the creative world of development and the rigorous world of security. If you are looking for an engineer who builds with a "Security-First" architecture, let's talk.
