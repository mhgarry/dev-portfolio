Hey there, thanks for stopping by. I'm **Matt**, a software engineer focused on full-stack web development, security, and scalability.

If you are looking for a standard, cookie-cutter developer, I might not be your guy. I didn’t take the traditional path. I didn't sit in a classroom for four years theorizing about code; I learned to work hard in the real world first.

Before I wrote my first line of Python, I spent years working in high-pressure restaurants while dedicating myself to writing and music. I didn't sit at a desk until I was 30. Why does this matter to you? **Because I know how to hustle, I know how to communicate, and I know that "good enough" usually isn't.**

### Beyond the Bootcamp: The Self-Taught Advantage

I don't have a Stanford CS degree. I have something arguably more valuable in this fast-moving industry: **an obsession with learning.**

While my bootcamp provided a foundation, I realized quickly that 16-hour days were just the warm-up. I understood that to be a true engineer, I needed to go deeper than the curriculum. So, I built my own curriculum.

I didn't just learn syntax; I taught myself:
* **The Fundamentals:** How compilers work, memory management, and Computer Science theory.
* **The Tools:** Bash scripting, CLI mastery, and Regex.
* **The Architecture:** Cyber security basics, the LAMP stack, and deep-dive DevOps (CI/CD).
* **The Languages:** I expanded beyond the basics into **Python** and **Go** to understand concurrency and backend performance.

I don’t wait for someone to teach me. If a technology solves a problem, I master it.

### My Philosophy: Secure, Scalable, Human

Building software is my outlet. It appeals to the musician in me—it requires rhythm, structure, and creativity. But unlike a song, software has to *work* under pressure.

My passion lies in building **secure, scalable, and non-invasive software**. I love the logic of it—the feeling of debugging a complex function until the entire application snaps into focus. But more than that, I love the tangible impact. I build things that improve people's quality of life.

### Let's Build Something Great

I am looking for a team that values clean code, ethical development, and relentless improvement.

If you want to follow the journey of a developer who brings the grit of the service industry and the creativity of an artist to your engineering team, you’re in the right place.
